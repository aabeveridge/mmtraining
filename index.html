      <h1 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
      <p>Social networks are a useful site for exploratory new possibilities for social and political research, for studying the flow of information, for investigating the sharing and remixing of digital artifacts, or for understanding the composition of particular user networks.</p>
      <h3 id="what-are-snippets"><strong>What are snippets?</strong></h3>
      <p>Throughout this textbook there are directions for saving “snippets” of terminal commands or code for later use. Wikipedia defines snippets as “a programming term for a small region of re-usable source code, machine code, or text.”<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The snippets suggested for saving from this section will be MassMine text commands and terminal commands for beginners to easily and quickly rerun MassMine. In later there are directions for saving snippets of R code for statistical analyses and data visualization. One of the most intimidating aspects of using a terminal or learning to program are the vast amount of terms, commands, syntax, and functions that must be remembered. By creating a basic workflow for saving snippets and recalling them later, the need for rote memorization is greatly reduced. Many text editors provide snippet management, and this will be addressed in later sections of this textbook. However, for this section, a simple text file for saving snippets will suffice.</p>
      <h3 id="creating-the-snippets-file"><strong>Creating the snippets file</strong></h3>
      <p>Open a text editor on your computer and add the following line at the top of a new text file:</p>
      <pre><code># massmine snippets</code></pre>
      <p>The <code>#</code> is a “comment” indicator common to many programming languages. Even though programming knowledge is not necessary for using MassMine to collect data, many of the conventions common to programming and reproducible research are suggested throughout the first sections of this book.</p>
      <p>Begin by saving a basic snippet for the help command. This snippet will use the help command to find the available tasks in MassMine:</p>
      <pre><code># massmine help command to find available tasks
      massmine --help=task</code></pre>
      <p>The first line in the snippet is a comment explaining what the command does, and the second line is the command itself. It is important to put commands on their own line to help error-proof the copying and pasting of commands. After a while, you will have many of the snippet commands memorized, but for now it is better to save important commands in your snippets file and to add descriptive comments to them.</p>
      <p>Minimize your snippets file, but do not close it. Throughout this section you will see <code>*add this command to your snippets file</code> after certain terminal commands. Please be sure to type the commands in the terminal first, and test them before writing them into your snippets file. It is important that you get used to typing in a terminal and that you test the commands before saving them. Also, keep in mind that terminal commands must be precise and they are case sensitive. Many errors are simply caused by typos or incorrect case. Errors are OK–do not fear breaking the computer by typing an incorrect command. If you receive an error, double check that your command matches the instructions exactly, and then try again.</p>

      <h1 id="api-authentication"><strong>API Authentication</strong></h1>
      <p>This section is for setting up MassMine for automated data collection. Often, API data sources require API credentials, and setup is necessary before MassMine can be authorized to collect data. This section explains how to access the required keys and tokens that allow API access, and how to save those credentials for use in ongoing data collection projects. The steps below are a one-time setup. Once completed, MassMine will automatically connect to the available data sources for collection projects.</p>
      <p><strong>The following MassMine sources DO NOT require credentials or setup for access:</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li>Wikipedia</li>
      <li>Google Trends</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="twitter-authentication">Twitter Authentication</h2>
      <p>To collect data from Twitter’s APIs (application programming interfaces) you must login to your Twitter account and create a new “application.” This “application” is not actually software or a computer program, but it is the access point through which MassMine collects data from Twitter. Every Twitter “application” is provided a certain amount of bandwidth<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and this limits the amount of free data an “application” may access through Twitter’s API. For more details on how Twitter limits data access through their API, visit the documentation pages for the Twitter APIs<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. MassMine assists users in collecting the maximum amount of data permitted by Twitter’s bandwidth restrictions.</p>
      <h3 id="massmine-help"><strong>1) MassMine Help</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>1.1</strong><br />
      If you have not installed MassMine, please refer to the newest installation instructions for your operating system at <a href="http://www.massmine.org/docs/install.html">www.massmine.org</a>. After MassMine has been installed, open a terminal and call MassMine’s help feature.</p>
      <p>Type in the following command into the terminal and press ENTER:</p>
      <pre><code>massmine --help</code></pre>
      <p>MassMine also accepts the short form version of the help command:</p>
      <pre><code>massmine -h</code></pre>
      <p>All of MassMine’s commands have a short form version, but for the sake of clarity the longer form commands will be used.</p>
      <p><strong>1.2</strong><br />
      It is important to familiarize yourself with the help feature. To use the help feature to find the <code>task</code> MassMine uses to authenticate Twitter, type in the following command and press ENTER:</p>
      <pre><code>massmine --help=task</code></pre>
      <p>Using this feature in MassMine shows that the correct command for Twitter authentication is:</p>
      <pre><code>twitter-auth</code></pre>
      <p>Later in this section you will need this command to authenticate MassMine with Twitter.</p>
      <p><strong>1.3</strong><br />
      Minimize your Terminal window and open your Internet browser.</p>
      <h3 id="creating-an-application"><strong>2) Creating an Application</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>2.1</strong><br />
      Setting up “application” access through Twitter requires a normal Twitter account. If you already have a Twitter account, using it to collect data through Twitter’s API will not affect your account. However, in order to add API access to your Twitter account, you must prove account ownership by providing your mobile telephone number. Go to your Twitter home page and click on <code>settings</code> in the drop down menu under the <code>profile and settings</code> tab.</p>
      <p><strong>2.2</strong><br />
      Next, click on the <code>mobile</code> side bar menu option to provide your mobile number.</p>
      <hr />
      <div class="figure">
      <img src="./images/mobile-twit.png" alt="" />
      
      </div>
      <p>Twitter will send a text to your phone with a code to confirm your phone number. Follow the steps provided by Twitter to finish confirmation.</p>
      <h3 id="application-setup"><strong>3) Application Setup</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>3.1</strong><br />
      After completing mobile verification, remain logged in to your account and go to <a href="https://apps.twitter.com" class="uri">https://apps.twitter.com</a>, and click on the <code>Create New App</code> button.</p>
      <p><strong>3.2</strong><br />
      On the following screen, fill in the boxes shown below. Under “Name” you will need to provide a unique application name, but “Description” and “Website” are allowed to be generic information.</p>
      <hr />
      <div class="figure">
      <img src="./images/create-app.png" alt="" />
      
      </div>
      <h3 id="application-secrets-and-tokens"><strong>4) Application Secrets and Tokens</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>4.1</strong><br />
      After creating the “application,” click on the application name and it will take you to the page for that application. In there you will click on a link in the middle of the page titled: “manage keys and access tokens.”</p>
      <hr />
      <div class="figure">
      <img src="./images/keys-click.png" alt="" />
      
      </div>
      <p><strong>4.2</strong><br />
      After clicking on “manage keys and access tokens” link, you will be redirected to the page that provides the credentials MassMine requires in order to collect data from the Twitter APIs. Keep this page open because you will need to copy and paste the keys and tokens on this page into MassMine.</p>
      <hr />
      <div class="figure">
      <img src="./images/keys-tokens.png" alt="" />
      
      </div>
      <h3 id="saving-application-secrets-and-tokens-in-massmine"><strong>5) Saving Application Secrets and Tokens in MassMine</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>5.1</strong><br />
      While keeping the keys and tokens page open in your browser, return to your terminal window and use the <code>twitter-auth</code> task as shown below. Type in the following command and press ENTER:</p>
      <pre><code>massmine --task=twitter-auth</code></pre>
      <p><strong>5.2</strong><br />
      You will be asked: <code>Would you like to setup your Twitter credentials?</code> Answer with <code>yes</code> and press ENTER to continue.</p>
      <p><strong>5.3</strong><br />
      Next you will be asked to enter your <code>Consumer Key</code>. Return to your browser window as shown in last image example above. Copy the consumer key from the web page, paste it back in your terminal, and then press ENTER.</p>
      <p><strong>5.4</strong><br />
      Follow the same process from Step 5.3 for the <code>Consumer Secret</code>, <code>Access Token</code>, and <code>Access Token Secret</code>. Once you have finished copying the 4 secrets and tokens into MassMine, you will see <code>Authentication setup finished!</code>.</p>
      <h1 id="starting-and-managing-a-data-collection-project"><strong>Starting and Managing a Data Collection Project</strong></h1>
      <h3 id="what-is-project-management"><strong>What is project management?</strong></h3>
      <p>Managing a long-term research project is not merely limited to collecting data and having a careful system for backing up files—although, file management is certainly an important aspect of project management. Project management also includes monitoring the content of the data, conducting test analyses, and adjusting the research as data collection is underway. Social network users and trends are dynamic, always shifting and changing, and therefore researchers interested in conducting social network research must prepare to shift the scope of their projects while collecting data.</p>
      <p>This chapter and the next chapter, “Developing a Research Question,” are complimentary. While the “Developing a Research Question” chapter explains the importance of understanding the available data types when developing a research project, this chapter is also relevant to the development of a research question. Often, it is not until data collection begins that a more viable or sustainable research question emerges. The incoming data may encourage other questions or redirect the project entirely, and therefore properly managing a data collection means paying close attention to the data while it is collected.</p>
      <p>However, sometimes researchers have no specific research question at the outset of a project and are interested in collecting data because something within a social network is relevant, trending, or possibly viral. In these cases, which are frequent, scholars need to start collecting data as soon as possible for exploratory purposes (and because many trends come and go quickly). This chapter will help you start collecting data quickly, and show you effective strategies for managing long-term research projects.</p>
      <p><strong>1.1 Starting a Project</strong></p>
      <p>MassMine can run directly from the command line by using the <code>task</code> function. Start by using the <code>help</code> function to determine which tasks are available for MassMine. Type the following command and press ENTER:</p>
      <pre><code>massmine --help=task</code></pre>
      <p>Below is another variation of this command. Both commands function the same and provide a list of the available tasks in MassMine. Type the following command and press ENTER:</p>
      <pre><code>massmine -h task</code></pre>
      <p>From the list provided by the <code>--help</code> command, we will use the <code>twitter-search</code> task. This task pulls data from Twitter’s Rest API, and it is a useful way to collect a small amount of historical data. Using the command below, MassMine will pull 10 recent tweets from Twitter’s Rest API, and save the raw JSON data to your working directory. Your “working directory” is the location on your computer’s hard drive where the terminal is currently operating. The following command is an example of how MassMine may run directly from the command line. This is only an example, do not run this command.</p>
      <pre><code>massmine --task=twitter-search --query=love --count=10 --output=love.json</code></pre>
      <p>Before starting to collect data, create a folder for your project. MassMine will create a basic project directory structure for you. Type the following command, but be sure to change <code>projectname</code> to the name of your data collection project and press ENTER:</p>
      <pre><code>massmine --project=projectname</code></pre>
      <p>If you typed the command correctly, MassMine returned a new command line in the terminal. Check your working directory to see if MassMine created your project directory. You should see a new directory in your current working directory. Type in the following command and press ENTER:</p>
      <pre><code>ls</code></pre>
      <p>*add this command to your snippets file</p>
      <p>The command <code>ls</code> is a general command for terminals that lists files and directories within your current working directory. You will likely memorize this command quickly, but it is a good idea to save it in your snippets file along with a quick description for now.</p>
      <p><strong>1.2 Running MassMine with a Configuration File</strong></p>
      <p>While MassMine is designed to run directly from the command line as shown in the example above, a more sustainable method for using MassMine repeatedly is to use the <code>--config</code> task to control MassMine with a configuration file. By using a configuration file, MassMine users can easily repeat or recall a previous MassMine data collection. Using a configuration file also makes it easier to remember exactly which query was used for a previous collection, and it simplifies keeping track of data collections that are already running in the background.</p>
      <p>MassMine’s configuration file setup takes the string of commands that operate MassMine at the terminal and places them in a single column in a text file. Therefore, the long command from above, <code>massmine --task=twitter-search --query=love --count=10 --output=love.json</code>, can be rewritten as shown in the example below. Open a new file in a text editor and type the following:</p>
      <div class="figure">
      <img src="./images/config-example1.png" alt="" />
      
      </div>
      <p>Save the new text file in the working directory for your project, and give it the same name as your project folder. If your project folder is called <code>projectname</code> then name your file should be <code>projectname.txt</code>. Following this naming convention will allow you to easily check on your collection projects that are running in the background. We will learn how to check up on collections running in the background later in this chapter. In your terminal use the <code>cd</code> command to change your working directory to the directory for your project. Type in the following command, but be sure to change <code>projectname</code> to the name of your project and press ENTER:</p>
      <pre><code>cd projectname</code></pre>
      <p>*add this command to your snippets file</p>
      <p>The <code>cd</code> command is a general command for terminals to “change directory.” By typing the name of the directory after the <code>cd</code> command, the terminal moves into the named directory as its new working directory. Like the <code>ls</code> command, you will likely memorize the <code>cd</code> command quickly, but it is a good idea to save it in your snippets file along with a quick description for now.</p>
      <p>Now that the terminal is working within the directory of your project, use the <code>ls</code> command to see if the config file has been saved in your project directory. Type the following command and press ENTER:</p>
      <pre><code>ls</code></pre>
      <p>You should see <code>projectname.txt</code> in your project directory. This text file is the configuration file that was created in the text editor and saved in your project directory. Using MassMine’s <code>--config</code> command allows this file to control MassMine. Type in the following command, but be sure to change <code>projectname.txt</code> to the name of your configuration file and press ENTER:</p>
      <pre><code>massmine --config=projectname.txt</code></pre>
      <p>*add this command to your snippets file</p>
      <p>If MassMine ran correctly, you will have seen the MassMine splash page followed by MassMine returning your terminal to a new blank command line. If you followed the directions above when creating your configuration file, then MassMine saved the collected data in the <code>data</code> directory in your project directory. Type the following command and press ENTER:</p>
      <pre><code>cd data</code></pre>
      <p>This command moves your changes the terminal’s working directory to the <code>data</code> directory. Use the <code>ls</code> command to see if the data was saved in the directory. Type the following command and press ENTER:</p>
      <pre><code>ls</code></pre>
      <p>You should see a file called <code>mydata.json</code>. If you want to adjust your data collection to collect a different dataset, simply reopen the <code>projectname.txt</code> configuration file in a text editor and change the commands to match a different data type or a new query. Make sure to change the filename for the <code>output</code> to a new file name, otherwise MassMine will not run. MassMine is setup so that it will not overwrite a previous dataset.</p>
      <!--**1.3 Managing a Long-Term Data Collection**-->
      <!--![](./images/config-example2.png)-->
      <!--###File conversion-->
      <!--**JSON**-->
      <!--The data file provided by MassMine is the raw JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). MassMine uses a tool called JSAN (Json Swiss Army kNife) to convert the raw JSON to CSV format. CSV file format is the most universally recognized format for spreadsheets data, and CSV files can be opened by any spreadsheet software. Keep in mind, however, that MassMine can collect large amounts of data, and common spreadsheet software will not work with extremely large CSV files. Later chapters explain how to use paralell processing methodologies to analyze large social network datasets, but for the earlier chapters we will work with data that can be analyzed in spreadsheet software.-->
