# **Introduction**

Social networks are a useful site for exploring new possibilities for social and political research, for studying the flow of information, for investigating the sharing and remixing of digital artifacts, or for understanding the composition of user networks.

### **What are snippets?**
Throughout this textbook there are directions for saving "snippets" of terminal commands or code for later use. Wikipedia defines snippets as "a programming term for a small region odigital artifacts, or for understanding the composition of particular user networks.f re-usable source code, machine code, or text."[^1] The snippets suggested for saving from this section will be MassMine text commands and terminal commands for beginners to easily and quickly rerun MassMine. In later there are directions for saving snippets of R code for statistical analyses and data visualization. One of the most intimidating aspects of using a terminal or learning to program are the vast amount of terms, commands, syntax, and functions that must be remembered. By creating a basic workflow for saving snippets and recalling them later, the need for rote memorization is greatly reduced. Many text editors provide snippet management, and this will be addressed in later sections of this textbook. However, for this section, a simple text file for saving snippets will suffice. 

### **Creating the snippets file**

Open a text editor on your computer and add the following line at the top of a new text file:

    # massmine snippets
    
The `#` is a "comment" indicator common to many programming languages. Even though programming knowledge is not necessary for using MassMine to collect data, many of the conventions common to programming and reproducible research are suggested throughout the first sections of this book. 

Begin by saving a basic snippet for the help command. This snippet will use the help command to find the available tasks in MassMine:

    # massmine help command to find available tasks
    massmine --help=task
    
The first line in the snippet is a comment explaining what the command does, and the second line is the command itself. It is important to put commands on their own line to help error-proof the copying and pasting of commands. After a while, you will have many of the snippet commands memorized, but for now it is better to save important commands in your snippets file and to add descriptive comments to them. 

Minimize your snippets file, but do not close it. Throughout this section you will see `*add this command to your snippets file` after certain terminal commands. Please be sure to type the commands in the terminal first, and test them before writing them into your snippets file. It is important that you get used to typing in a terminal and that you test the commands before saving them. Also, keep in mind that terminal commands must be precise and they are case sensitive. Many errors are simply caused by typos or incorrect case. Errors are OK--do not fear breaking the computer by typing an incorrect command. If you receive an error, double check that your command matches the instructions exactly, and then try again.
